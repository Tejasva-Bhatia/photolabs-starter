The **PhotoLabs** project is a web application developed as part of the Web Development React course. It serves as a practical implementation of React concepts and full-stack development.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of PhotoLabs is to provide a platform for users to explore and interact with a collection of photos. Users can view photos, toggle a details modal, and mark their favorite photos.
